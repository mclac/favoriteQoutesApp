# My Node Favorite Qoute's App

So this is a simple Node.JS app with a RESTful API using the MEAN stack. The front end is mostly all Bootstrap. Actually I was insipired by Bootstraps qoutation style and built the app around it. I did end up tweeking the default Bootstrap CSS a bit to give it a bit more flavor. Since it's just a simple demo its not as robust as a proudction app eg. tehre isn't much error handling. Check out the live demo here at this link https://infinite-lake-78886.herokuapp.com/#/ . I'm working on a more complicated chatApp at that will be far more robust with user logins, websocket utilization, proper testing and error handling. Anyway thanks for checking this out. Also feel free to fork or use this as a base for any app though it's geared more towards chat/communications apps.
